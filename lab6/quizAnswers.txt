1-
booyah references the function
booyah() calls the function ( the output of the booyah must be a function)

2- two alerts with 6

3- 		function booyah1() {
            alert('BOOYAH!');
        }

        function booyah2() {
            return function () {
                alert('BOOYAH!');
            }
        }

4- is a general approach to the use of client-side JavaScript in web pages so that if JavaScript features are partially or fully absent in a user's web browser, then the user notices as little as possible any lack of the web page's JavaScript functionality
